# llvm-cookbook

This cookbox contains a collection of snippets that I commonly use in my projects.

Each snippet has a set of characteristics:

- They are focused,
- They are isolated,
- They are runnable, and
- They are trivial

As far as possible there is not clutter surrounding the snippet which might distract from the concept that is being illustrated.
